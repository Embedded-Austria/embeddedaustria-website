### Beyond docker build — Securing your docker life-cycle

The attack vectors for containerized software are not limited to breaching confinements and privilege escalation on running deployments. This talk broadens the scope of docker vulnerabilities over the complete life-cycle, starting from supply-chain attacks, ensuring authenticity through every step of your deployment process, to continuous vulnerability monitoring by leveraging SBOMs.

**About:** Erwan Sudran is an experienced Team Lead with a demonstrated history of working in the computer networking industry. Strong information technology professional skilled in Negotiation, Environmental Compliance, Safety, Management, and Leadership. Felix Ring is Project Engineer at TTTech Industrial Automation AG.

### Living on the Edge — Securing containers on embedded platforms using eBPF

Edge computing and embedded systems transition to cloud native applications – in this development, Linux and virtualization gain more adoption in industrial and automotive use cases. The resource consumption of containers makes them interesting for isolation of software on Edge devices — but is a container secure enough? This hands-on talk presents cloud technologies and their security posture relevant for industrial and embedded use cases.

**About:** Reinhard Kugler is a dedicated professional with a strong emphasis on software engineering and practical IT security. With a solid background as both a software engineer and system administrator, he brings extensive expertise in automation and system integration. Currently, Reinhard's work centers on leveraging containers, embedded Linux, and cloud technologies.

### Report from the Field: Practical Usage of Containers in Railway

Using containers can be done for a number of reasons. While security is probably the most prominent one, this talk discusses other reasons why containers have been in use in A&R TECH devices in the railway and off-highway market for the past 6 years. We want to give some insight into applications out in the field as well as others that are seen not only feasible but beneficial for future applications.

**About:** Andreas Gabriel-Platschek has been working on embedded applications for the last 20 years in different roles, from developer to safety manager, security manager and captain of a system software team. His interests are mostly low level kernel development but when working in rather small companies it is inevitable to cover a big span of topics.

Raphael Rippl has over 7 years of experience in embedded applications, starting as a developer before transitioning to roles as a security manager and captain of the user space team. His main interests are in software development, mainly in C++.
