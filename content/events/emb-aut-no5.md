As embedded systems become increasingly connected, developers face growing pressure to meet new security and compliance requirements. In this event, we'll explore how the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and NIS2 directive are shaping the future of embedded software. We'll also discuss relevant norms, standards, and the tooling ecosystem that can help teams stay compliant and efficient. Join us to learn, share, and connect with others navigating these changes.
