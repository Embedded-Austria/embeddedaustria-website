### Embedded Linux Security: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

Linux-based embedded systems are not uncommon these days, but they still have some rough edges, especially regarding security. In their talk, David and Richard will outline common problems they encounter when working with their customers on embedded systems. The goal is to make you aware of these critical pitfalls you should definitely avoid in your next project.

**About:** Richard Weinberger is co-founder of sigma star gmbh where he offers consulting services around Linux and IT security. Upstream he maintains various subsystems of the Linux kernel such as UserModeLinux and UBIFS. Besides low-level and security aspects of computers, he enjoys growing lithops.

**About:** David Gstir is a security researcher and software engineer at sigma star gmbh with 15+ years of hands-on experience in designing, engineering, and auditing software for various use cases. He obtained a master's degree in computer sciences from the University of Technology Graz, Austria where he specialized in IT security and cryptography.

### Flutter on Embedded Devices

In December 2018, Google presented the Flutter framework 1.0. This framework aims to be a cross-platform library for developing user interfaces. Starting with the focus on mobile platforms, there are now also backends for Windows, Linux desktop, MacOS and embedded Linux. The technical architecture of the rendering engine currently relies on an independent layer for native OpenGL or Vulkan support. In order to support native code integration, you can work with so-called "platform channels". In the talk, we demonstrate an implementation of a Flutter application on a NXP i.MX8 and discuss practical aspects of how to use this approach in industrial embedded software projects.

**About:** Stefan Larndorfer is the CEO of sequality software engineering and manages various embedded software projects in the areas of automotive, industry automation and medical engineering. Together with his team at sequality.at he develops innovative software solutions based on embedded Linux, C++ and HTML5. He is also a lecturer for C++ Qt at the Upper Austrian University of Applied Sciences in Hagenberg and supervises student projects and diploma thesis.

### From Pixels to Insights: An Eye on the Edge AI

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the emergence of edge devices as potent platforms for AI execution stands out as a transformative development. These devices, embedded within our daily environments, possess the capability to perceive, analyze, and act — all in real time. This talk delves into the state of AI on the edge, spotlighting the latest advancements, key enablers, as well as how to get started quickly with helping your edge device to see.

**About:** With over half a decade of experience building AI solutions, Dejan has delved into diverse domains ranging from leveraging patient imagery for improving clinical diagnostics to developing real-time video analysis tools for consumers, and presently, pioneering computer vision in additive manufacturing. At the heart of his work is the mission to endow devices with the power to see and act intelligently.
