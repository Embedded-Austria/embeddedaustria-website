Join us for this Embedded Austria event, where we will explore the latest developments in real time operating systems (RTOS). Learn about how those operating systems are being used to power a wide range of devices, from smart watches to industrial machinery. Get practical advice from experts on how to develop and deploy RTOS applications.

### Managing Firmware with FreeRTOS

This talk provides a broad overview of common firmware challenges and strategies for addressing them in FreeRTOS. It will explore the ecosystem, focusing on architectural patterns in driver design, data handling, and event processing. The goal is to spark a productive exchange of ideas and experiences.

**About:** Stefan Jaritz is a highly experienced Senior Embedded Software Engineer. He has worked with advanced technologies such as RTOS, Bluetooth communication protocols, and IoT solutions, contributing to projects like bone conduction headsets, e-scooter infrastructure, and smart headphones. His expertise spans full-stack development, including firmware, system integration, and production tooling, with a strong background in Linux.

### Zephyr OS

This talk will cover the basics of Zephyr RTOS. It discusses the fundamentals of the Zephyr RTOS, how the source and build structure is setup, and what is different from alternatives like Arduino. Setting up a simple hello world (or blinky) project shows how to use the device driver, where to get information about boards, and how to compile and flash the device. Finally, some practical examples are presented, which show the wide variety of applications.

**About:** Christian Hirsch is an entrepreneur, researcher, hobby beer brewer, and gardener. He is working in the field of smart farming, sensor networks, and low-power communication techniques over short and long distances. Since May 2022 he is self-employed and develops and sells sensor-based irrigation solutions with Bluetooth Low Energy and cellular IoT communication technology. In addition, he started working as a researcher for the Research Studios Austria in February 2023 working on smart farming and IoT.

### RIOT OS

RIOT OS is an embedded operating system maintained by a diverse community, supporting portable application development from 8-bit microcontrollers up to just below where one might run Linux. The presentation introduces the OS, shows examples of using it with the C and Rust programming languages, and gives a peek at related activities such as developing free drivers and open standards, both available through RIOT OS.

**About:** Christian Amsüss has been actively involved in Free Software communities since 2005. He has been developing connected embedded devices since 2011. His objective is to help pave the way towards a Web of Things where interoperability is standard, users maintain control, and security is built in by default.
